# paint-with-ml

![](imgs/screenshot.png)

This app uses a version of the GauGAN deep learning model to transform an input segmentation masks into a landscape painting.

GauGAN, released in 2019, is the most powerful image-to-image translation algorithm currently known. This version of the model has been trained on the popular ADE20K dataset, then fine-tuned on a dataset of 250 paintings from Bob Ross's beloved PBS series, "The Joy of Painting".

Choose from nine different semantic brushes to craft your painting. Then click on the "Run" button to generate a result! Here are some example outputs:
